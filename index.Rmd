I am an Epidemiology MPH candidate (’26) at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, applying to Biostatistics PhD programs for Fall 2026. I conduct research under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Malinsky.

My research leverages graphical models for causal inference: structure learning, complex networks, and algorithmic fairness. Interests include aging, neuroscience, cheminformatics, and social bias mitigation.

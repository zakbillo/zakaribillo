Iâ€™m a MPH candidate '26 and Tow Doctoral Scholar in the Epidemiology Department at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. Currently, I'm applying to Biostatistics PhD programs.  

My research lies at the intersection of Biostatistics and Epidemiology: developing causal inference methods for structure learning and algorithmic fairness. Specific areas of interest are aging and bias in social policy. I do research under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.dmalinsky.com/">Daniel Malinsky</a>.  

Before this, I received a BS in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
